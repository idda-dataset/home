## ITALDESIGN<br>Partnering Innovation for Concrete Solutions
Italdesignâ€™s roots date back to February 1968, when Giorgetto Giugiaro and his partner engineer Aldo Mantovani started a 
design studio that represented an innovative formula for the car industry: a service company able to assist OEMs in design, 
engineering and industrial development up to validation and homologation, without producing vehicles on its own, and envisaging 
a strong combination in simultaneous engineering of design, development and production, so to offer an organic set of methods, 
techniques and tools allowing a product and production process integrated design approach, embracing concepts such as time-to-market 
and design-to-cost.
<br><br>Today, Italdesign is a state-of-the-art customer-centric, method- and fact-based company operating in four major areas: 
Design, Engineering, Production and New Mobility Solutions.
Headquartered in Moncalieri, Turin, Italy, the company counts up to 1,000 employees working in premises in Italy and abroad.
<br><br>In the mid-1970s, the activities widely expanded also in the Industrial & Transportation Design domains as well as in 
the Graphics Multimedia & Communication fields, translating quality design, engineering and research into transportation solutions 
whatever (trains, rolling stocks, aircraft interiors, sea crafts...), articles for medium and high volume production, packaging, 
corporate identity and graphics. Architecture, interior design and urban design were also investigated.
In almost forty years of experience, the Industrial Design Division of Italdesign has achieved a solid know- how, while working 
in several fields and co-operating with national and international organizations: over 1,000 projects were accomplished from 
concept design to production.
