I'm glad to introduce you IDDA, a new synthetic dataset though for semantic segmentation applied to autonomous driving.
The ItalDesign DAtaset is a large-scale multi-domain dataset created to explicitly address the challenges of domain 
shift between train and test data in various weather and viewpoint conditions and in seven different cities. 
The variety that IDDA offers allows for a deeper analysis and benchmarking of the performances of the current state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation architectures, with a very strong focus on the domain adaptation task.
