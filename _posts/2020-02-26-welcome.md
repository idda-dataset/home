I'm glad to introduce you IDDA, a new synthetic dataset though for semantic segmentation applied to autonomous driving.
The ItalDesign DAtaset, created in partnership with the [Italdesign company](https://www.italdesign.it) will ve the largest 
synthetic multi domain dataset developed to explicitly address the challenges of domain 
shift between source and target data in several illumination and viewpoint conditions and in seven different towns. 
The variety that IDDA offers allows for a profound analysis and benchmarking of the performances of the current popular
semantic segmentation architectures, with a very strong focus on the domain adaptation task.
