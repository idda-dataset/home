I'm glad to introduce you IDDA, a new synthetic dataset thought for semantic segmentation applied to autonomous driving.
The ItalDesign DAtaset, created in partnership with the [Italdesign](https://www.italdesign.it) company, once released, 
will be the largest synthetic multi domain dataset developed to explicitly address the challenges of the domain 
shift between source and target data.
The variety that IDDA offers, from the several illumination and viewpoint conditions to the seven different towns, allows
for a profound analysis and benchmarking of the performances of the current state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation architectures, with a very strong focus on the domain adaptation task.
<br>
<br>
The **News** will be constantly updated with the latest information concerning IDDA, the new open challenges and the 
further introduced benchmarks.
