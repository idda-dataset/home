The dataset is now available for download. Please fill out and submit the form found on the [Download Page](https://idda-dataset.github.io/home/download/).
A confirmation e-mail will be sent to you, along with a link to the download. 
We'll provide you access to the IDDA subsets we looked at in our [paper](http://ras.papercept.net/images/temp/IROS/files/2790.pdf). 
In the coming weeks, more subsets will be added. Don't forget to [cite us](/home/bibtex) if you use IDDA in your work!
